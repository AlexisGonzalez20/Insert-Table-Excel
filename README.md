## Info

We have developed a compact and efficient tool that allows automatic import of Excel tables to tables in the database. This tool is built using PHP 8.2 and Laravel 11.31, with the Laravel Excel 3.1 package and the Query Builder to manage the queries to the database.

The main controller that performs this task is located in the Controller folder and is called InsertTableExcelController. Additionally, we have provided an example file located in Controllers\Api\ExampleController to make it easier to understand and implement this functionality. This example file includes detailed instructions and comments that explain each step of the process, allowing developers to adapt it to their specific needs.

The tool has been designed to be easy to use and highly configurable, ensuring seamless integration with various data structures and databases. By automating the import process, the time and effort required is significantly reduced, thereby increasing efficiency and accuracy in data management.
